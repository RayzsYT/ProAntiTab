Confused about the display of missing parts in the console?
It's actually quite easy to read and I'll show you how its done! :D

Let's take the for the following missing path:
--> test-feature.enabled

In the config.yml, this would look like this:


test-feature:
  enabled: true


Now another example with something more fitting to your case:
--> info.version.updated

In the config.yml, this would look like this:

info:
  version:
    updated: ...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Then what should I copy or how should I transfer the information from the one to the other config.yml?
Well, it's actually quite easy. Just take a look on what is missing.
If PAT says, something like this is missing:
- test-feature.enabled
- test-feature.message
- test-feature.failed

Then this basically just means, that the entire section for "test-feature" is missing.
In other words, check the "comparable-config.yml" and look for the "test-feature" section.
It would look like this:

test-feature:
  enabled: true
  message: "Hello World"
  failed: "Error ;c"

Just copy the entire thing and paste it somewhere in the config.yml.
Once you've reloaded the plugin then, using "/(b)pat reload", everything should work fine.

If something went wrong, PAT will let you know! ^^
