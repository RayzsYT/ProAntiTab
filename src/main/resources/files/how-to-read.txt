Confused about the display of missing parts in the console?
It's actually quite easy to read and I'll show you how its done! :D

Missing parts are written in this format right here: xyz.zyx.idk
A more befitting example would be something like:
--> test-feature.enabled

In the config.yml, this would look like this:


    test-feature:
      enabled: true


Here's another example of this format:
--> info.version.updated

In the config.yml, this would look like this:


    info:
      version:
        updated: ...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we know how things from the missing parts look like in the config.yml, let's go over to the more important part.
Inserting the missing parts to your current config.yml. But how and what exactly?

Well, it's actually quite easy. Just take a look on what is missing.
If PAT says, something like this is missing:
- test-feature.enabled
- test-feature.message
- test-feature.failed

Then this basically just means, that the entire section for "test-feature" is missing.
In other words, check the "comparable-config.yml" and look for the "test-feature" section.
It would look like this for example:


    test-feature:
      enabled: true
      message: "Hello World"
      failed: "Error ;c"


Just copy the entire thing and paste it somewhere in the config.yml.
Once you've reloaded the plugin then, using "/(b)pat reload", everything should work fine.

If something went wrong, PAT will let you know! ^^


Here's a more close to your case example. Let's say your config.yml looks like this:

    handle-through-proxy:
      ...

    turn-blacklist-to-whitelist: true

    custom-protocol-ping:
      ...


and now let's say PAT says that "base-command-case-sensitive" is missing.
Then this would be what PAT is looking for as solution:

    handle-through-proxy:
      ...

    turn-blacklist-to-whitelist: true

    base-command-case-sensitive: true/false

    custom-protocol-ping:
      ...


On how exactly it needs to be implemented can be seen in the comparison-config.yml file,
as this is the original version which would be generated by default.
