# (!) Warning: If you have a Bungeecord/Velocity server, please enable this option!
# (!) How to use it properly can be seen on the following page:
# (!) https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/113172/field?field=documentation
# (!) At the first section ("How to setup") are spoilers with different server scenarios.
# (!) Open the spoiler that matches your server scenario and follow the instructed steps in there.
# Enabling this allows the Bungeecord/Velocity and backend servers to communicate with each other.
# Information that are being communicated with are for example settings of certain features, but also important
# data about groups, commands and much more, that are very important for the tab-completion & suggestions!
# Affected features that are being synced with, or overwritten by the proxy, are marked as ">> HTP".
