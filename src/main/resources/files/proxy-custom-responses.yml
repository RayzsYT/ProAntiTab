#  custom-responses.yml
#
# Here you can configure a few of the blocked commands a bit further.
#  But what exactly does that mean? Well, this simply means that you can create unique custom-responses
#  for certain or even all commands that are blocked by PAT.
#  Just add the commands that you want your custom response for that would be blocked by PAT
#  and make your boring blocked-message more unique! :D
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# What are these action section at each block?
#  This is an additional feature to make your responses much more alive.
#  Example actions that can be used are the following:
#   Send alert notification:
#        Syntax: alert
#        Example: alert
#   Execute console command:
#        Syntax:  console::command
#        Example: console::say %player% is an evil player
#   Execute player command:
#        Syntax:  execute::command
#        Example: execute::help
#   Send actionbar:
#        Syntax:  actionbar::text
#        Example: actionbar::&cThis is not cool %player%!
#   Send title:
#        Syntax:  title::title::subtitle::5::20::5
#        Example: title::&aTest title::&cHello %player%!
#   Play sound: (Available sounds: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html)
#        Syntax:  sound::soundName::volume::pitch
#        Example: sound::ENTITY_ENDER_DRAGON_GROWL::1.0::1.0
#   Give potion effect:
#        Syntax:  effect::potionEffect::duration::amplifier
#        Example: effect::BLINDNESS::45::1
#   Send console message to backend server:
#        Syntax:  p2b-message::text
#        Example: p2b-message::&cPlayer &4%player% &cdid something bad.
#   Execute console command on backend:
#        Syntax:  p2b-console::command
#        Example: p2b-console::tp %player% 0 0 0
#   Execute player command on backend:
#        Syntax:  p2b-execute::command
#        Example: p2b-execute::help

#   Variables to work with:
#     %args[from-to]% to get the command arguments
#     Example if you've typed: /shop open gui user
# A:
#     %args[1]% = shop
#     %args[2]% = open
# A-B:
#     %args[1-2]% = shop open
#     %args[1-3]% = shop open gui
#     %args[2-4]% = open gui user
# A_:
#     %args[1_]% = shop open gui user
#     %args[2_]% = open gui user
#     %args[3_]% = gui user
# _B:
#     %args[_1]% = shop
#     %args[_2]% = shop open
#     %args[_3]% = shop open gui

# Here are a few examples:


# Example for all blocked commands.
# This applies to all commands as well as sub-arguments,
# unless you have specified another custom response.
# (!) Make sure to put this custom-responses on the very bottom of all
#     your custom-responses, since PAT iterates through each of all
#     your custom-responses, since PAT iterates through each
#     custom-response by order.
#example-with-everything:
#  triggers:
#    - "*"
#  message:
#    - "&cI'm blocked"
#  actions:
#    - "actionbar::&cSorry %player%, but this command is blocked."
#    - "sound::ENTITY_ENDER_DRAGON_GROWL::1.0::1.0"



# Example for only one command and all its sub-arguments.
# Only triggers if "help" or "help ..." is executed and also blocked by PAT.
#example-with-help:
#  triggers:
#    - "help"
#    - "help *"
#  message:
#    - "&aSorry, but help isn't here."
#  actions:
#    - "actionbar::&aSorry %player%, but there's no help."
#    - "sound::ENTITY_ENDER_DRAGON_GROWL::1.0::1.0"



# Example with kits.
# Only triggers if the player executes the "kit" command with a sub-argument that
# is blocked by PAT.
# --
#example-with-kits:
#  triggers:
#    - "kit *"
#  message:
#    - "&cThis kit does not exist!"
#  actions:
#    - "actionbar::&cSorry %player%, but this kit does not exist!"



# Here another example with an auctionhouse plugin.
# Only triggers when "ah plugin" is executed and also blocked by PAT:
# ---
#example-with-auctionhouse:
#  triggers:
#    - "ah plugin"
#  message:
#    - "&cThis sub-command does not exist. Please type: &e/ah help"
#  actions:
#    - "console::say That's not nice %player%!"
#    - "effect::BLINDNESS::45::1"
#    - "sound::ENTITY_ENDER_DRAGON_GROWL::1.0::1.0"
#    - "title::&cHey!::&cYou can't do that %player%!::5::20::5"
#    - "actionbar::&cNop, sorry %player%"
